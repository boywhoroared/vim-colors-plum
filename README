Light and dark colorscheme especially effective with GUIs.

To switch between dark and light backgrounds set the 'background' option accordingly:

    :set bg=dark or :set bg=light

If you are a Mac OS X user you can take advantage of the camera to detect the current 
ambient light and automatically set the background (dark or light) accordingly.
